# Huffman Coding

Implementation of [Huffman Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding). 

Tested on the lyrics of [Murder of the Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zUPTPlkqDg) by King Gizzard and the Wizard Lizard.

```
Uncompressed File Size: murderoftheuniverse.txt: 2.5K
Compressed File Size:   out: 1.8K
Compression Ratio: (uncompresed size) / (compressed size) = 1.39
```

i.e. compressed file is 72 % of the size of the uncompressed file. The compression ratio would depend on the number of unique characters in the uncompressed file; the fewer characters, the higher the compression ratio.
